1. Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number n.
2. Write a program to print multiplication table of 10 in reversed order.
3. A do while loop is executed:
a. At least once.
b. At least twice.
c. At most once.
4. What can be done using one type of loop can also be done using the other two
types of loops – true or false?
5. Write a program to sum first ten natural numbers using while loop.
6. Write a program to implement program 5 using ‘for’ and ‘do-while’ loop.
7. Write a program to calculate the sum of the numbers occurring in the
multiplication table of 8. (consider 8 x 1 to 8 x 10).
8. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop.
9. Repeat 8 using while loop.
10. Write a program to check whether a given number is prime or not using loops.
11. Implement 10 using other types of loops.
