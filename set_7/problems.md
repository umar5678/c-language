1. Create an array of 10 numbers. Verify using pointer arithmetic that (ptr+2) points
to the third element where ptr is a pointer pointing to the first element of the
array.
2. If S[3] is a 1-D array of integers then *(S+3) refers to the third element:
(i)
True.
(ii)
False.
(iii)
Depends.
3. Write a program to create an array of 10 integers and store multiplication table of
5 in it.
4. Repeat problem 3 for a general input provided by the user using scanf.
5. Write a program containing a function which reverses the array passed to it.
6. Write a program containing functions which counts the number of positive
integers in an array.
7. Create an array of size 3 x 10 containing multiplication tables of the numbers 2,7
and 9 respectively.
8. Repeat problem 7 for a custom input given by the user.
9. Create a threeâ€“dimensional array and print the address of its elements in
increasing order.
